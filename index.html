<h1> The Wonderful World of the World Wide Web </h1>
<body>
<b>What is the <em>World Wide Web?</em></b>
<p>
It is a collection of HTML documents!
<br> Check out this interesting video on the origins of the internet: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTsNIfBR-dc">Internet Revolution</a>.  
</p>
<b>What is <em>HTML</em>?</b>
<p>
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the basis for almost every web page!
<br>
<br>
HTML is made up of:
<br>
- text content (what you see)
<br>
- mark up (how is it arranged)
<br>
- references to other documents (images and videos)
<br>
- hyperlinks (links between pages)
<br>
<br>
<b>Some  basic HTML vocabulary</b>
<p><b>Tag</b>: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and closing tag.
such as the paragraph tag. Some tags called "void" tags do not require a closing tag. An example of that is the break tag. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Element</b>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags
<br>
<br>
<b>Attribute</b>: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Facebook URL, you would write <a href="www.facebook.com">Facebook</a></a>.
</p>    
</p>
<p>
<b>What is <em>HTTP</em>?</b>
<p>
It is the main protocol of the web!
<br>
See its history in the following link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>.
</p>

<b>Computers are <em>STUPID</em>...</b>
<p>
Which gives programmers the power to tell computers what we want it to do! Computers take everything literally.
